# Weather-Application


## Description

I wanted to create a weather application which allows users to search a location and display the current results on top of the page and a 5 day forecast at the bottom of the page. The application will save and display your searches, which are saved to localStorage so the user can view the past searched locations. The search history displays as a button on which the user can click and get the results. 
This project seemed easy and straight forward when I first took it on, though when working though it I had to step back and draw out what I want to application to do and how to do it. It helped me understand how and when I want information to be displayed and saved to history. 

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
On the main page, type in the location and hit either the search button or press enter. If location not found or typed in incorrectly, a message will apprear for three seconds stating location not found. 

Upon successful search, the current weather will display along with the 5 day forecast at the very bottom and the search will be logged and display in the "Show History" block.

You can click on the button in the history block to view the weather for the past searches.
